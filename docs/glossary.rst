   Packet
      In the context of this module, the term *Packet* is used synonymously with *Bundle*. That means that whenever *Packet* is used, it refers to the data unit used on the overlay network layer created by the `Bundle Protocol <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5050>`_. It refers **NOT** to packets of all underlying layers like on the transport layer of the Convergence Layers.
