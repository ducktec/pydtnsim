pyDTNsim - a DTN simulation environment
=======================================

*pyDTNsim* provides a simulation environment that allows the simulation of arbitrary Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) scenarios on a packet level. *pyDTNsim* provides users with the ability to evaluate the performance of various routing approaches and to detect possibly occurring overload situations. Currently, the focus lies on deterministic Contact-Graph-based routing approaches, but there might be other approaches available in the future. The clear modularization allows users to easily implement routing approaches on their own.
